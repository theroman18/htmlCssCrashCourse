    <h1 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">Hello, my name is Roman Sanchez</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      I love to play guitar and piano as well as hang out with friends.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: red;">Music</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      I enjoy going to concerts and I really loved seeing these two bands, <em>Phoenix</em> and <em>Green Day</em>. I've seen many other artists but those two bands were the first ones that I remember as my favorites. You can see the other artists I've seen <a href="music.html" style="color: green;">here</a>.

    <h2 style="color: red;">Running</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      I use to run <strong>six days a week</strong> in high school since I was in cross country and track. I miss running and I plan on getting back to it.
